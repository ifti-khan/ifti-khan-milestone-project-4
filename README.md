## Project Title - UR-GYM

### Introduction
This repository is showcasing my fourth and final milestone project for The Code Institute.

For this project I have chosen to do an ecommerce website for a gym that I have made up called UR-GYM. This web application will also users to register, login and purchase gym merchandise as well as gym memberships and also ask for advice. 

The reason I have chosen to do this as my fourth and final milestone project is that it will allow me to showcase the new Django skills learnt from The Code Institute and my previous skills from other projects. The key skills being showcased here are the Django framework, MySQL database and the Bootstrap framework 

# UX â€“ User Experience
## The Who?
The project will be designed for enthusiastic gym users who want to find and purchase gym merchandise online as well as gym memberships and seeking advice from other gym users. 

## The What?
The project will be aimed users who want to find and purchase a gym membership ranging from one month to twelve months. It will also allow them to find and purchase gym merchandise which will include clothing items, supplements, and protein powders. 

Once they have found what they are looking for, the user can then purchase items by filling in the relevant information and make the purchase. The Project will also allow users to connect with other gym users by allowing them to create posts asking other users for advice on certain subject, which will create an online social community. 

## The How?
I will be using a variety of different technologies and techniques to create this project, the first is the Django framework, along with the Bootstrap framework and a MySQL database to store product information. 

The web application will allow all users to find and make a purchase, but registered user will have the ability to view order history and store personal information. Also a registered user will be able to ask a question to other users by creating a post, as well as leaving a review on a certain product. A website admin role will be present, the admin will have full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality over products and posts.

## Technologies Used
Here is a list of programming languages that I used to create this project along with a list of database storage, software, frameworks, libraries and tools I also used to create this project.

### Programming Languages

* HTML5 -> [Visit Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML5)
    * HTML5 was used to create the overall structure and page elements to be viewed in a web browser.

* CSS3 -> [Visit Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS)
    * CSS3 was used to give my project and its content style, layout, colours, a different font and format.

* JavaScript -> [Visit Site](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript)
    * JavaScript was used to give my project an interactive look and feel and to be used to interact with APIs.

* Python -> [Visit Site](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
    * Python and Django were used to create the backend server side logic of the web application.

### Database, Frameworks, Libraries, Software & Tools Used
* Sqlite3 Local Storage -> [Visit Site](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html)
    * This was the default database installed once Django was installed. This Database was used in the development stage of the project and then all data was migrated to Postgres. 

* Postgresql Heroku Storage -> [Visit Site](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql)
    * This database tool was used once my project was deployed to Heroku, this is an add-on that Heroku provides once your Heroku project is created. Once this add-on is chosen and a unique database URL is automatically generated within the setting of the Heroku app.

* Django v3.2.4 -> [Visit Site](https://www.djangoproject.com/download/) 
    * This version of Django was used within my project to help create it. The reason I chose Django because of it rapids development, security and flexibility. 

* Bootstrap CSS/JS v5.0.1 CDN -> [Visit Site](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/download/)
    * Bootstrap will be used for the responsive side of my project and for the interactive visual elements as well.

* JQuery v3.6.0 -> [Visit Site](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/jquery)
    * JQuery will be used to manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM), create animations and events.

* Font Awesome v5.15.3 CDN -> [Visit Site](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/font-awesome)
    * The Font Awesome CDN will be used for the icons that I use within my project to help give the project good visual elements and a good user experience.

* Google Fonts -> [Visit Site](https://fonts.google.com/)
    * Google fonts has been used to import the font I have chosen directly from google into my main CSS file.

* GitHub -> [Visit Site](https://github.com/)
    * I used GitHub to store my project files by creating a repository for it and then using the Git terminal and its commands to version control and store my files.

* Heroku -> [Visit Site](https://www.heroku.com/)
    * Heroku was used to deploy my web application because GitHub can only deploy static websites where as Heroku can deploy websites with backend server side capabilities. My GitHub repo is linked to my Heroku app, so when I push changes to my repo Heroku will also update and deploy the latest changes.

* Amazon Web Service (AWS) -> [Visit Site](https://aws.amazon.com/?nc2=h_lg)
    * AWS was used during the deployment stage of my project, I used AWS to store and host my static files and media content for my project. 

* Gitpod -> [Visit Site](https://www.gitpod.io/)
    * I used this online development environment because of its integration within GitHub. With a click of a button within any repo or browser extension, Gitpod will open up and I am ready to code without installing any physical programs on my laptop.  

* Visual Studio Code -> [Visit Site](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    * I used this code editor as well but this was mainly used as a backup, because of Gitpods 50 hour usage limit per month. I chose VSCode because Gitpod utilises VSCode so I was familiar with it. Another reason is because of it built in Git functions, which allowed me to clone my repositories easily and pull, commit and push to my repositories.    

* Balsamiq Desktop -> [Visit Site](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/)
    * Balsamiq was used in the design stage where I created my wireframes for my project to help me get visual representation of what my project could look like.

* Paint 3D -> [Visit Site](https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/p/paint-3d/9nblggh5fv99?activetab=pivot:overviewtab)
    * Paint 3D was used to crop screenshot images and then saved to an appropriate image format.

* Google Chrome & Chrome Dev Tools -> [Visit Site](https://support.google.com/chrome/answer/95346?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
    * Google Chrome and Chrome Dev Tools was used to help create my project as well as testing it using the developer tools.

* Markdown Table Generator -> [Visit Site](https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables)
    * This online tool helped me to create the markdown tables for testing section of my readme file.

* Django Secret Key Generator -> [Visit Site](https://miniwebtool.com/django-secret-key-generator/)
    * This online tool was used to help generate a secure key for Django secret key variable within my project.

* Temporary Email Address -> [Visit Site](https://temp-mail.org/en/)
    * This online tool was used to create test users during the development of my project, to test my projects registration, login and emails.

* JSON Formatter -> [Visit Site](https://jsonformatter.org/)
    * This online tool was used to help format my JSON files for my categories and products that were then imported into my database to populate it with data to display. 

* Python Tutor -> [Visit Site](http://pythontutor.com/)
    * I used this online tool to help me be better understand my python code because it allowed me to see my code visually run step by step.

* Bootstrap Cheat sheet -> [Visit Site](https://hackerthemes.com/bootstrap-cheatsheet/)
    * This website was used to help with the calling of my bootstrap classes within my HTML and CSS. 

# Validation
In this section I have used a few different validation tools to thoroughly check and make sure my project code is fully compliant and accessible. If there is any non-compliant code or warnings within the project I will document it and then fix it and this will be the first step of my testing and debugging.
