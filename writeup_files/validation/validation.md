# Validation

## HTML5 Validation
I have tested all of the HTML files using the HTML5 W3C validator and got some interesting results. The validator does not seem to recognize Django template language and it showing a large number of errors. 


## CSS3 Validation
Here I have tested all of the CSS files within the project using the CSS3 W3C validator and got one error which was caused by a comma. That error was corrected and the file was validated again with no errors, so all my CSS files pass the CSSÂ£ W3C validation.

## Python PEP8 Validation
At the beginning of this project I installed a linter by the name of flake 8 within VSCode and set that as my default linter, this can be seen in the requirements file - flake8==3.9.2 has been installed. Throughout the entire project I made sure my python code was PEP8 compliant by making sure line were not too long, no unused variables and more. 

There is 4 lines of code in the settings file which cannot be made PEP8 complaint and they are to do with the Django password auth.
